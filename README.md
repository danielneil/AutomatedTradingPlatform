# AutomatedTradingPlatform

Nagios is known for being a tool to help IT folks monitor IT infrastructure, but with a few tweaks it can be used as a trading platform.

This is a simple proof of concept which turns Nagios into a full blown trading platform that enables it to use a strategy to identify and execute upon trading opportunities.  

The strategy is simple mean reversion, coupled with shorts analysis, and the chosen financial market is the ASX. 

I am available for consultation and employment.
